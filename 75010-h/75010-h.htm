<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> author in presenting this little volume does so
with the intention of assisting his readers to solve
some of the mysteries and illusions that are performed
on the public stage to-day by conjurors and
so-called spiritualists, and also with the hope of dispelling the
idea that these mysteries are accomplished by occult or supernatural
methods, which belief is growing to quite an extent
in this country.</p>

<p>The author has made a very careful study of the many
illusions both in magic and in spiritualism, and of the transmission
of thought, which is known by a great many different
names, and in this little volume he intends to show how these
illusions may be performed by purely mechanical means. It
should be borne in mind, however, that it is not so much the
apparatus employed as it is the shrewd, ever-observing
methods employed by the performers, who are very sharp,
keen men. The devices employed by the performers are so
numerous that it is impossible to say just what methods they
will use next. As soon as one method is exposed they immediately
begin to plan, and evolve an entirely different
method of performing the same illusion. The great success
of the magician is in disarming the suspicions of the skeptic,
and this is accomplished by leading him to think a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
method is employed when he is really using another.</p>

<p>The author merely offers some solutions and points out
certain fundamental principles which are usually employed,
and which he thinks will assist his readers in solving these
mysteries for themselves. No literary merit or perfection of
style is attempted in this little volume for it is written in
every-day language, but I hope it may prove of interest and
value to my readers.</p>

CABINET TRICKS.</h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-c.jpg" width="42" height="50" alt="drop-cap">
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Cabinet</span> tricks have always been a great stand-by
for performers in spiritualism. A committee from
the audience is usually chosen, and after tying the
performer securely to a chair or board or in some
other way binding him very securely, he is then placed in a
cabinet, the curtains drawn, and immediately manifestations
take place, such as the ringing of bells, the banging of tambourines
and playing of guitars.</p>

<p>I will now explain three of the latest and best cabinet
tricks which I know. The first is known as the “Mahatma
Miracles,” and the effect of same is as follows:—</p>

<p>A cabinet with a translucent gauze opening in the front
curtain stands on the stage and is freely inspected by a committee
to see that there are no double backs, sides or tops.
The medium then takes a seat in the cabinet and passes his
or her hands through two apertures in the sides of the cabinet,
where they are tied with ribbons and the ribbons held
on the outside of the cabinet by the committee. The curtains
are now closed, but due to the translucent gauze opening in
the front of the curtain the medium’s head and shoulders are
seen by all. In spite of this, however, bells are rung, tambourines
played, a glass of water is raised to the medium’s
mouth, a newspaper which is placed on the floor of the cabinet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
is cut into beautiful designs, and many other manifestations
take place.</p>

<p>The secret of this trick lies in the cabinet. It is an ordinary
cloth one, with a raised platform about four feet square.
The front curtain, as above mentioned, has a gauze opening
about eighteen inches in diameter, and the two side curtains
have openings large enough to allow the medium to pass his
hands through. The legs of the cabinet are about six inches
high and five inches in diameter. The secret of this cabinet
lies in one of the front legs, which is hollow. The floor of the
cabinet is laid off in squares so that one of the squares comes
over the hollow leg and acts as a trap. A strong screw-eye
is screwed in the under side of the trap and a rope attached
to same. This rope passes down through a hole in the floor
to an assistant underneath the stage, who holds the trap down
while the committee inspects the cabinet.</p>

<p>The medium takes his seat on a chair in the cabinet, and
passes one hand through each aperture in the sides, where
they are securely fastened with ribbons or ropes, the ends of
which are held by the committee. The curtains are now
closed and the tests occur. The assistant under the stage
works everything by pushing his hand and arm up through
the hollow leg. He is thus able to ring the bells and play
the musical instruments which are placed on the floor. In
the glass-of-water test the assistant has a stuffed glove, with
wires running up each finger, which is painted flesh color,
and is fastened to a stick. He bends the wire fingers of this
glove around the glass of water and pushes same up to the
medium’s mouth. In regard to the paper test. An ordinary
newspaper is placed on the floor of the cabinet with a pair of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
scissors. The assistant promptly draws this paper down
through the hole in the floor and places another paper, cut
into beautiful designs, on the floor of the cabinet, where it is
found when the curtain is drawn aside. Many other tests can
be performed, all of which I think will now be clear. It is
needless to say that the assistant must always pull the trap
down and hold it tightly by the rope after each test so the
committee can discover nothing upon examining the cabinet.
The medium gives the assistant a signal when to open the
trap by tapping his foot on the trap. The cloth of the cabinet
should be of some dark material.</p>

<p>The spiritualistic post test is the next which I will describe.
In the most common form it consists of a post of
pine wood two and a half feet long. This is given to the
committee, one of whose members bores a hole through it,
near its upper edge, and then passes an ordinary rope through
the hole. A knot is then tied in the rope on each side of the
post. The knots are pressed against the sides of the post to
prevent the rope from being pulled through the hole. The
ends of the rope are now unravelled, and the post is fastened
to the floor with spikes. The medium takes a seat behind the
post and his hands are securely tied to the post with the unravelled
ends of the rope. Small pieces of court plaster are
pasted over the knots so as to prevent him from slipping his
hands from the fastenings. A nail is driven into the top of
the post and a rope is secured to it. This second rope is
held by the committee. A screen is now placed around the
medium. Bells are rung, etc., showing that the medium has
the use of his hands.</p>

<p>The secret of this trick consists in boring a hole in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
center of the end of the post. A chisel is then inserted in
the hole and the opening closed with glue and sawdust colored
with paint. In boring the hole through the post the
medium starts the bit so that there is no danger of the committee
boring the hole too low or so high that it will strike
the chisel. When the nail is driven in the top of the post it
forces the chisel down and cuts the rope. The medium may
now ring bells, etc. After the medium is through he puts the
rope ends back in the hole in the post and holds his hands
very tightly against the post while the knots are inspected by
the committee.</p>

<p>I will now explain what is known as the cotton bandage
test, which is usually used by female mediums. A male performer,
as a rule, uses rope or wire. In this experiment the
committee is chosen from the audience and furnished
by the performer with pieces of cotton cloth about an inch
and a half wide and three feet long. One of these cotton
strips is tied securely around each wrist of the medium, the
performer instructing them to tie a number of good hard
knots. As an extra precaution, a needle and thread is now
furnished and a number of stitches are made above the knots
to prevent them from getting untied. Strips of court plaster
are also fastened over the bandages on wrists to prevent them
from being slipped off the hands. The medium now places
her hands behind her, and the ends of the strips from each
wrist are now tied together by a number of good hard knots
by the committee. What ends are left are evenly cut off near
the knots. Another strip of cloth is now produced and one
of the committee ties this strip around the knots between her
wrists, leaving the ends of about equal length. The medium
now takes her seat on a small stool with her back toward a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
ring in a board which has been fastened to the floor. One
end of the last strip is passed through the ring and several
knots are tied. Another strip is produced and tied around
the medium’s neck and then tacked against the upright board.
Two more strips are now used, tying one around each arm
above the elbow, and the ends of same are also tacked to the
board. The committee having done all this work themselves
are thoroughly satisfied as to its genuineness. As an extra
precaution, to show that the medium does not use her limbs
in any way, a cord is tied around both feet, an end of which
is held by a member of the committee.</p>

<p>A cabinet is now placed over the medium, and no sooner
is the curtain closed than the usual manifestations take place,
such as the ringing of bells, tooting of horns, banging of tambourines,
driving of nails, etc., etc. Each time the curtain is
opened the medium is seen with her hands apparently securely
tied as before. Finally a pocket knife is placed in her
lap, the curtain is closed for a few seconds, and soon the
medium comes forth with her bonds cut, but only the wrists
separated. This is supposed to be done by the spirits. Now,
I will explain this mystery.</p>

<p>In a convenient pocket in the back of the medium’s dress
or in her belt she has slipped a small sharp open knife, with
which she cuts through the bands between her wrists. She is
able to do this as her hands are not tied absolutely tight together,
because in tying the bandages around the wrists the
performer instructs the committee to tie a number of good
hard knots, and furthermore to sew the bandages together
about two inches above these knots. These knots are also
tied on the inside of wrists or above the palms of the hands.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
It will be readily seen that when the loose ends are tied together
there is a three or four inch space between her hands,
so it is not at all difficult for her to cut herself free. She
cuts the bandage which connects her wrists close to the band
which fastens her to the ring and slips this bandage off,
leaving it whole and still tied to the ring, and now has the
free use of both hands, and as the strips tied around her arms
were tied above her elbows she has full use of her forearms,
and is thus able to raise a glass of water to her mouth, tie
knots in a handkerchief around her neck and drive nails into
a chair. She makes what manifestations she chooses, and by
placing her wrists one on each side of the ring and clasping
her hands together, pressing all tightly together, she is ready
for examination. The ring being wound with cotton cloth the
same as used in the bandages the committee cannot see that
anything has been changed, and, being a little ill at ease upon
a public stage, they are ready to say that she is bound
without making the most thorough examination possible. Another
thing to notice is that she is finally cut free. The reason
of this is that if the investigators were to release her they
would discover the secret.</p>

<p>This cotton bandage test is also performed in a little
different manner, in which the medium is not cut free at all.
In this case, when she places her hands behind her, she rests
one hand on each hip so that her hands are about nine inches
apart, and then has the committee tie the four ends together
and then fasten her as in former case. She is now able by
reaching with her left hand in back of her as far as possible
to slip her right hand into her lap and get hold of what musical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
instruments are placed there. At first thought this may
seem impossible, but with a little practice and some contortion
on the part of the performer it is quite easy to perform
the trick in this manner.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br>
TABLE LIFTING.</h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-m.jpg" width="42" height="50" alt="drop-cap">
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Most</span> spiritualistic performers usually perform a test
of table lifting or of floating tables. Small, light
tables are lifted by the mere “laying on of hands.”
The arms are raised in the air and the table is seen
to cling to the hands and follow every motion. This is
accomplished by a pin driven well into the table, projecting
above the table about a quarter of an inch. There is a good-sized
head to this pin. The performer wears a ring with a
slot in it. The body of the pin easily enters the slot in the
ring, but the head of the pin being of good size prevents the
table from falling away from the hand. After the table has
been floated successfully an extra strong upward pressure of
the hand pulls the pin out and the table can be examined.
This trick may be performed when the table is covered with
a borrowed silk handkerchief, as the handkerchief, being of
fine, soft texture, does not prevent the pin slipping into the
slot cut into the ring. This addition makes the trick a little
more effective.</p>

<p>There is also another method employed of raising a table
which has been examined beforehand by a committee, who
also examine the performer’s hands to see that there is no
sticky substance on them. In this method, instead of having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
a slot cut into the ring, a strong needle point is soldered to
the outside of the ring and at a slight angle to it. This ring
is placed upon the performer’s hand so that the point is sticking
toward the tips of his fingers. The ring may be turned
upon his finger so that the point can be concealed between
the fingers when his hands are being examined. When he
performs this trick he merely turns the point around to the
inside of his hand, and the top of the table being of some
soft texture, such as cardboard or wood covered with felt,
he is able to push this needle point well into the top of the
table, and is thus able to raise it without trouble.</p>

<p>Small, light tables are sometimes floated in the air with
the performer holding his hand well above the table and not
touching it at all. This is easily accomplished by having two
strings running from one side of the stage to the other
worked by assistants. They merely raise these strings from
the floor so they come underneath the table, when by a little
effort they are able to raise the table completely off the floor.</p>


<h3>THE OBEDIENT HANDKERCHIEF.</h3>

<p>This little trick is usually performed in connection with
some other handkerchief trick or with some act in hypnotism.</p>

<p>The performer having borrowed a handkerchief from
some one in the audience for some trick, before returning
same to the owner states that he is going to try and make
the handkerchief stand alone. He ties a knot in one corner
of the handkerchief, rubs it between his hands, “to endow it
with magnetism,” and then places same on the floor. At his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
command the handkerchief rises or falls, it dances to music,
and altogether acts in a very strange manner. He now picks
the handkerchief up and carries it forward to its owner.</p>

<p>There are several methods of performing this little experiment,
and, while not much of a trick in itself, if well presented
it is very interesting. The old method used to be of
having a string extending from the floor to the ceiling and
thence passing over a small pulley to the back or side of the
stage. On the end of the string on the stage was a small
bent pin or a pellet of wax. The performer when tying the
knot in the handkerchief stuck the pin in the corner of same
or stuck the wax to the handkerchief, whichever method was
used. His assistant from the side of the stage was now able
to operate the handkerchief. This was somewhat of a clumsy
method, as it took a little dexterity to release the handkerchief
from the string after the performance. The method
now usually employed, and on which the details are worked
out with care, is to have a fine black string passing from
one side of the stage to the other. The performer has an
assistant at both sides. When he is to perform this trick
they raise the string to the height of his hands, and in tying
the knot in the handkerchief he ties it loosely around the
string. He now drops it to the floor, and at his command the
assistants are able to raise the handkerchief and make it
move forward and backward in a very mystifying manner.
To heighten the effect the performer passes a chair or a tambourine
over the handkerchief, thus showing that there is no
connection made from above, which is the method usually
supposed to be employed. Now, when he returns the handkerchief
one assistant drops his end of the string and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
other holds his firmly, and the performer walking down to
the front of the stage with the handkerchief, the string is
drawn through the knot.</p>

<p>Another method of fastening the string to the handkerchief
may be employed where the performer is able to carry
the handkerchief to the side of the stage before performing
the experiment. In this case he passes a needle to which is
attached a thread through a corner of the handkerchief, and
then walks to the other side of the stage, where he gives one
assistant an end of the string, the other end being held by
the assistant on the first side.</p>

<p>There is also another method of performing this, in
which the performer passes a solid hoop completely over and
around the handkerchief while it is suspended in the air
This little contrivance, being one of my own, consists of a
fine piece of wire made on the same plan as the apparatus
used in suspending a woman in mid-air, which I will explain
in the next chapter.</p>

THE FLOATING GIRL.</h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="42" height="50" alt="drop-cap">
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> following illusion is usually performed in connection
with an act of hypnotism, and is very sensational
and mystifying. The effect is as follows:—On
the stage is a long, narrow couch with back
and ends, usually upholstered in some dark material. The
legs of the couch are about twelve inches high, and the
audience are able to see plainly underneath the couch. The
performer introduces a young lady, and apparently hypnotizes
her. She then lies down upon this couch and the performer
continues to make more passes over her, arranges
the draperies of her dress, and sometimes covers her with a
small shawl. He then takes a position in back of the couch
directly over her and continues his hypnotic passes. To the
wonderment of all, she is seen to rise slowly from the couch
to a considerable height. The couch is now removed by two
assistants, and she is apparently suspended in mid-air. To
disprove the agency of any mechanical appliance the performer
now has brought to him a solid wooden hoop, which
he passes completely over, in back, and again over the suspended
girl. His two assistants then bring back the couch,
and she slowly sinks back upon the seat of same. The performer
now rouses her from her hypnotic sleep, she rises,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
bows to the audience and retires.</p>

<p>I will now explain how this illusion is usually performed.
It can only be performed on a theatre stage or where there is
plenty of room underneath, as this is where the working of
the trick takes place. There is a false seat to the
couch, which consists of a board from four and a half to
five feet long and from six to eight inches wide. This board
is upholstered in the same material as the couch, and when
laying on the seat of the couch cannot be noticed. There is
a small slot cut in the back of the couch in the very center,
from the top down to the seat. This slot is hidden by the
upholstery so it cannot be noticed by the audience.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_19.jpg" alt="floating girl platform">
</figure>

<p>I will now call attention to the accompanying cut, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
the aid of which I can better explain this illusion. “A-B” is
the board or false seat which I have described. In this diagram
we are supposed to be looking directly down upon it.
At “G” there is firmly connected to this board a heavy metal
coil, as illustrated in the cut. This coil consists of three
metal bars, numbered, respectively, “1, 2 and 3.” This entire
apparatus is in the same horizontal plane as the board “A-B.”
The connection “G” is made through the slot in the back of
the couch of which I spoke, and the back of the couch extends
between rod “No. 1” and the board “A-B,” running out considerably
beyond the ends of this board. It will now be seen
if this metal coil is raised upward it will carry with it the
board “A-B.” At “F” there is a small stud, connected to metal
coil either by welding or having the bar bent over. This
little stud is of triangular shape and several inches long, and
is at right angles to the metal coil and perpendicular to the
floor. The smaller cut “F” at the right will make this plain to
the reader.</p>

<p>This stud “F” fits firmly into a bar having a triangular opening
at its end. This bar is pushed up through a small trap
in the stage from underneath same. This bar is free to move
up and down, but otherwise is firmly secured underneath
stage. Underneath it is a strong screw-jack, which is capable
of raising the complete apparatus above, even with the additional
weight of the young lady reclining on the board “A-B.”
The performer, after the young lady lies down on the seat
of the couch, in reality on the board “A-B,” walks around in
back of the couch and stands close up to bar “No. 3” with
his right leg in the space “H.” The stud “F” is thus in back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
of his right leg. The small trap in the floor is now opened
and the bar is pushed up in back of the performer’s leg and
connected with the stud “F.” The bar being painted black
would not be noticeable against the performer’s black trousers
and shoes should it come into view. It is, in fact, hidden
from view by the performer’s right leg. All the performer
has now to do is to remain in this position, and heighten the
effect by his spectacular play, such as hypnotic passes directed
toward the young lady. His assistants underneath the stage
merely raise the young lady by screwing up the jack, or
raising her by whatever appliance may be used. When she
comes to a position above the top of the couch the couch
may be removed by two assistants of the performer. Of
course, it will be understood that the dress and draperies of
the girl will completely hide the board and the apparatus in
back of same.</p>

<p>Now, for passing the solid wooden hoop over the suspended
girl. To do this the performer takes the hoop in his
left hand, passes it over the end marked “A” of the board
and down between rods “No. 1” and “No. 2,” the hoop assuming
the position of that in the diagram marked “D.” It
is now carried forward by the performer’s right hand and off
at the end of board “B.” The hoop is now turned around
and assumes the position “C.” The whole hoop is now
passed in back of the girl, running between rods “No. 2” and
“No. 3.” When it reaches the end of the board “A” it is
again passed over the girl and board and assumes the position
marked “E.” It may now be completely withdrawn from
off of the end marked “B.” The performer may now reverse
the motion of the hoop by starting it at “B” if he chooses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>The foregoing is somewhat difficult to explain, but if
the reader will bend a piece of wire into the shape as above
and take a small ring and follow these directions he will see
how this is accomplished.</p>

<p>The position which the legs of the couch occupy are
marked off on the floor, so that when the couch is returned
it will be in the same position as at first, and thus the little
bar “G” slips through the slot in back of couch when the
girl is again lowered. This slot may be cut diagonally
through back and then cannot be seen. When the board
“A-B” comes to rest on the seat of couch the bar which
passes up through the hole in the floor is now withdrawn
through the floor and the trap closed. The performer then
walks around to the front of the couch and apparently
awakens his subject.</p>

<p>Some performers have a different connection with the
rod from under the floor, having a thread cut on the end
which screws into the coil at “F.” This may be a more secure
fastening, but it takes longer to insert and remove.</p>

<p>I wish to call attention to the fact that this little diagram,
which is made very roughly, is not drawn to scale, being more
to illustrate the course of the hoop than for any other purpose.
The small semi-circular space “H” has a diameter of
about a foot, and the performer stands in this, the semi-circular
hoop encircling his leg. The apparatus may be raised
up as high as performer’s waist or even higher, and the hoop
will then be encircling his body, while the rod connected to
“F” running through the floor will be hidden by the performer.</p>

<p>This illusion was first performed by having the girl lie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
on a couch or upon a board supported by two wooden
horses, quite close to the rear curtain of the stage, and instead
of having the connection made underneath the floor a rod
was passed through a slot in the back curtain which connected
to the metal coil. The end of the rod in back of the curtain
was firmly fitted into a heavy block which slid up and down
in a perpendicular frame. This block, by means of ropes
and pulleys, could be raised or lowered by the assistants in
back of stage. Without a doubt, however, the method of performing
this illusion now, where the performer stands over
the girl in the center or even in the front part of stage, is
very much better and more mystifying in every way.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">As</span> far back in history as one cares to go he will find
mention of magicians and the works of magic which
they performed. Even before the building of the
Pyramids in Egypt magic was a reputed art.</p>

<p>We read in the Bible of Aaron casting down his rod
before Pharaoh and his servants and its becoming a serpent.
The magicians of Egypt then being summoned by Pharaoh
did likewise with their enchantments, turning their rods into
serpents. (Exodus, Chapter seven, Verses ten and eleven.)</p>

<p>Magic was greatly in vogue in the middle ages, and we
read weird tales of ghosts and gnomes in literature of that
time.</p>

<p>One of the earliest of the necromancers of whom we
read was Joseph Balsamo, known as Count Cagliostro. He
married a very beautiful girl at Rome, who proved of great
assistance to him in his impostures, and with her and a
retinue of servants traveled all over Europe and scattered
money right and left. He, however, reaped an abundant
harvest by his impostures. He was very cordially received
wherever he went, and was believed in by serious-minded
and educated men. In Paris he became involved in some
affair and was thrown into Bastille. Though eventually
liberated, he was compelled to leave Paris. Cagliostro was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
the last to win any great fame as a pretender to occultism,
although there was a feeble attempt to revive thaumaturgy
in the nineteenth century by Madame Blavatsky. Science,
however, has laughed away sorcery and witchcraft.</p>

<p>In London, 1784, we read of Chevalier and Madame
Pinetti, and his wonderful experiments of new discovery.
We read of Madame Pinetti being seated in one of the front
boxes of the theatre, blind-folded, and guessing at everything
imagined and proposed to her by any person in the company.
Here we have the first mention of the second sight trick
which, in the hands of latter-day artists, has become so
popular. Houdin rediscovered it, passed it on to Robert
Heller, who improved it, and at the present day Keller and
others make it a feature of their performances.</p>

<p>Heller’s performance was very remarkable and mystified
the people for years, even after his death; in fact, until Mr.
Fred Hunt, Jr., who was Heller’s assistant for many years,
made an <em>exposé</em> for the “London Times.”</p>

<p>Heller used to perform with his sister, Haidee Heller.
She was introduced to the audience blind-folded and seated
upon the stage. Heller would then go among the audience
and receive from them various articles, which Miss Heller
accurately described. Heller’s method consisted of a very
elaborate code of words, which system he so simplified as to
embrace every variety of article, classified in sets. One
question with a word or two added sufficed to give the desired
information to his sister, who had a thorough knowledge of
the code, and she could at once describe any desired article.</p>

<p>Heller also had a silent method of performing these
tricks, in which he did not speak a word, and this effect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
puzzled every one. It was accomplished by means of electricity.
A confederate sat among the spectators, near the
center aisle of the theatre, and the wires of an electric battery
connected with his chair, a small push button being
under front part of seat. The wires ran from the confederate’s
chair to the floor and under the carpet and underneath
the stage, then up to the floor of the stage, and connected to
a small metal plate. The chair on which Miss Heller sat had
two little pins in one leg, and these were placed upon the
metal plate in the floor. In the chair was a little mechanical
contrivance connected with wires which ran through the
woodwork and down through the leg of the chair, and connected
to the two little pins before mentioned. When the
chair was placed on the plate the connection was made, and
when the button was pressed by the confederate the little
contrivance used made a slight tapping upon the chair which
could be heard or easily felt by Miss Heller. In this manner
the code used by them could be telegraphed by the assistant.
Heller would bring the article to be described down near
where the assistant sat so that he could see it, and he would
then telegraph in their code a description of what the article
might be to Miss Heller, who sat blind-folded on the stage,
and she, to the wonderment of all, would accurately describe
the article.</p>

<p>This method of telegraphing information to an assistant
has been used by later performers in a slightly different
manner. The assistant is concealed at the side of stage
where he can see the audience and performer. The medium
is blind-folded, and a committee of gentlemen come upon
the stage and write numbers on a blackboard. The blind-folded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
medium adds or subtracts, and tells whatever figure
is pointed to by any one in the committee; also tells the
value of cards, and gives other tests in numbers.</p>

<p>The assistant at side of the stage can see all numbers on
the blackboard and can also see the cards. He communicates
the answer to the blind-folded medium by pulling a
little string which runs under the stage and which causes a
little metal rod to come up through a small hole in the stage
floor. The medium sits with her foot directly over this small
hole, and also has a hole about one inch in diameter cut in
the sole of her shoe. Now, when the string is pulled the
small rod presses against the medium’s foot, and when the
string is released the rod, which is fastened to a spring or
stout elastic band, again recedes into the floor.</p>

<p>Suppose the sum of several columns of figures on the
blackboard is 5037. The assistant at the side of stage quickly
adds them up himself, and then pulls the string seven times,
and the medium calls out in slow tones, as if under great
mental pressure, (not foot pressure) “Put down number
seven.” The assistant now pulls the cord three times and
pauses. “The next figure is number three,” says the medium.
To telegraph the cipher the assistant now gives a long steady
pull. The medium now calls for cipher, and then on receiving
five pulls calls out the last number five. She is thus able
to tell any number pointed to by any one. When vacant
space is pointed to the assistant does not pull the string, and,
there being a long pause, the medium knows that no figure
is being pointed to, and says: “You are not pointing to any
figure.” The signal to stop is a series of two pulls in rapid
succession.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that the assistant cannot see what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
number is required, say, for instance, the number on a watch
or the date on a coin. In this case the performer communicates
with the assistant by sign language, and the assistant
now telegraphs the desired number or numbers to the medium.
The signs may be gotten up as in the following table:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Closing right hand, sign for number 1.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Frowning, sign for number 2.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Smiling, sign for number 3.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Right hand on hip, sign for number 4.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Raising eyebrows, sign for number 5.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rubbing chin, sign for number 6.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Drawing mouth to right, sign for number 7.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rubbing ear, sign for number 8.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hand to brow, sign for number 9.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Looking to floor, sign for 0.</div>
  </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>A great many signs can be used, and most performers
have their own. The telegraphic method is very good for
tests in numbers, but for the communication of words or
questions is too slow, and it is also difficult for medium to
get the question, if it be a long one, as she cannot write it
down, and, therefore, this method is not often used in anything
but number tests.</p>

<p>Some of the performers in magic around the country
are now giving very mysterious exhibitions in thought transmission.
Notably among these are the Baldwins, known as
the “White Mahatmas,” and the Fays in their act called
“Thaumaturgy.” Their performances are remarkable, and I
will now describe the effect, and offer some solutions to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
mystery. I do not say that the methods I suggest are the
only ones used, for there are so many methods that it would
be impossible to describe them all. I will merely tell the
principal methods employed for producing these effects by
purely mechanical means. Now, for a description of the
tricks performed by some of the present conjurors.</p>

<p>The performer announces that his assistant, who is usually
a woman, and whom I choose to call a medium in the
following description, will read and answer questions written
by the people in the audience, which they may have written
at home on their own paper or at the theatre. He instructs
them to write a short question and sign their name if they
wish an answer, then to fold the question up and place same
in their pocket or pocketbook. For the convenience of those
who have not written their questions at home the performer
and the ushers distribute slips of paper and pencils among
the audience. They also pass out pieces of millboard to act
as a rest on which to write the question. They (the performer
and ushers) disclaim any preparation of these millboards
and they are only passed out to obviate the inconvenience
of writing on the knee. A number of these boards
are torn in two and given to the audience to examine, and
keep as souvenirs, if they so wish. This is done to show that
there is no preparation about the boards. After the questions
are written the boards are brought back by the ushers
and laid upon the stage in view of all. A little vaudeville show
now usually takes place, which occupies a half-hour or so, the
star performance or that of thought transmission or telepathy
being held until last.</p>

<p>Before commencing this last part the performer makes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
a few remarks and impresses it upon the audience that if they
wish their questions answered they must concentrate their
minds upon them, for if they oppose “the one with attributes
not usually utilized by man” or think that the medium cannot
read their questions then she cannot, and they will not be
answered. He instructs the audience that if any person’s
name be called, whether he or she has written a question or
not, to promptly respond by raising his hand so as to put
himself in direct communication with the medium. Why
the raising of the hand, which is somewhat embarrassing to
a person, places him into closer or more direct communication
with the medium the performer fails to explain. To
assist the audience to concentrate their thoughts on the questions
he bids them take out their questions from their pockets
or purses or wherever they may be concealed, and occasionally
read them over. At this point a rustle of paper is usually
heard all over the house, showing what faith the audience
have in the performance.</p>

<p>The performer now presents the medium. She is very
carefully blind-folded, and then mesmerized by the performer.
A large sheet is now usually thrown over the medium,
ostensibly to shut out material vision and to retain the personal
magnetism, which cannot escape through the white
sheet, provided it be a very white one. The performer and
ushers now distribute themselves about the theatre, and the
medium now starts in something after the following:—</p>

<p>“Sitting down stairs and to my right there comes to me
the name of Smith. I believe it is Clarence R. Smith.”</p>

<p>Now the performer requests Mr. Smith to raise his hand,
which he does, and the medium continues:—</p>

<p>“He is sending me a thought about himself. Now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
concentrate your thoughts, Mr. Smith, and think very hard,
and I will see if I can get your question. Yes! He says:
‘Will I be successful?’”</p>

<p>Mr. Smith now states that this is the question which he
has written, and the medium now proceeds to answer him in
something of this manner:—</p>

<p>“I see no reason, Mr. Smith, why you will not be successful,
and I think you will. However, you will make a
change in a short time and will leave your present position as
bookkeeper for Brown &amp; Jones.</p>

<p>“You wrote that question out at home, Mr. Smith, and
on a card, didn’t you?</p>

<p>“Yes,—I thought so. It is written in ink, and you wrote
it at your home, No. 734 Main Street. Am I not right?”</p>

<p>Mr. Smith now states that everything the medium has
told him is correct as far as he knows.</p>

<p>The performer now collects the card from Mr. Smith
and brings it down to the front of the house, and calls attention
to the fact that it is not written on his paper. If there
is some printed matter on the card he may ask the medium
to read what is there, and she, after a little hesitation, does
so.</p>

<p>This test which I have described would be known as a
star test, as the question was written outside of the theatre
and besides reading and answering the question she describes
the card on which it is written.</p>

<p>I will now enter into an explanation of a variety of
methods used, or that may be used, to perform these seemingly
remarkable experiments, by the pure aid of science and
trickery.</p>

<p>The very innocent-looking little millboards play a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
important part in performances of this character. Out of a
lot of about fifty boards there are twelve to fifteen that are
“faked” in a manner which I will presently describe. The
rest of the boards are, however, without any preparation,
and can be broken open and examined by any one. The
“fake” boards are prepared by inserting under the top thin
layer of the board a piece of white paper and over this a sheet
of carbon paper. The thin layer or face of the board, really
a piece of brown paper, is now pasted down around the edges,
which, when sandpapered off, bears casual inspection without
disclosing the secret. Both sides of the board may be prepared
if desired, but one side is usually deemed sufficient, for
the ushers who pass out the boards know which is the “fake”
side. They place a piece of paper on this side and pass it to
the person to write on, and not one person in a hundred will
turn the board over to write on the other side. Any question
written on the paper, using this board as a rest, will be transferred
by means of the carbon paper to the sheet of white
paper underneath. The ushers armed with a handful of good
solid boards and four or five “fake” boards now pass among
the audience. By a little practice they are able to pick out a
skeptic or any one whom they think may cause trouble by
stealing a board or tearing it open for the purpose of discovering
the secret in the board. To those they give the
genuine boards, and if that person should now break it open
for the purpose of exposing the performer he feels very cheap
on finding no preparation about it. As before stated, to all
of those of whom the ushers are suspicious they pass genuine
boards, and to others they pass the “fake” boards with paper
and pencil, and they are very careful to get all of these boards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
back. They may occasionally break open a good board to
show that there is no preparation. Several questions can be
written on each prepared board, as the questions, being brief,
are not apt to be written on the same part of the board, and
even if they are can easily be read.</p>

<p>The ushers, after they have collected all the boards, retire
to the back of the house, where they slip the “fake” boards
under their coats or vests, and then bring down the genuine
ones with some little show, holding them above their heads
and throwing them carelessly down upon the stage, where
they remain during the entire performance.</p>

<p>The performer also passes out some boards to be written
on, but as all eyes are on him he has no opportunity to slip
any of these boards under his vest, so he uses only genuine
boards, and is not very particular whether they are returned
or not. Questions written on these boards are not answered,
that is, not by any assistance of the boards, but they may be
answered by some of the other methods, which I will describe
later.</p>

<p>The ushers now carry their boards around to the back
of the stage to the medium, where they are arranged in piles.
The usher who distributes the boards on the right side of the
house places his in one pile; a pile is also made by the usher
from the left of the house, another by the usher from the
center of the house, and still another by the usher from the
gallery. In this way it is known in what part of the house the
questioner sits.</p>

<p>A paper knife is now inserted under the top sheet of
board and the top sheet removed and the white sheet with the
copy of the questions on it is taken out. The medium and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
her assistants now either cut these questions out, making little
slips of them, or copy them into a little book, making
notes regarding the answers under each question where it is
necessary. Of course, the sensational part of the performance
is in the answers the medium gives, and the quicker and
cleverer she is in her answers determines the success of the
performance.</p>

<p>The medium and assistants now, while the vaudeville
show is taking place on the stage, work up the answers. They
are provided with recent issues of local papers from which
they can get information about local affairs, and also are
able to post themselves on the latest stock quotations, if any
question is asked about them, and there usually are a number.
They also have a directory of the town they are in, which
contains a great deal of useful information for their business.
Suppose the medium only has the name of some man in
the audience. She can look that person up in the directory,
find out his business and his home address, and, by consulting
the street directory, can find out his next-door neighbors.
If, in her performance, she calls out this man’s name, telling
him she cannot seem to catch his question, as he does not
concentrate his thoughts upon it, she may bring in, in a very
clever manner, the information which she has obtained from
the directory, telling him where he lives and naming his
neighbors, also telling him where he is employed. This makes
a very good impression on the audience, especially if the
man is well-known in the town and one who all would know
was not in collusion with the performer. The directory also
gives a list of all city and town officials, names of all physicians,
clergymen and lawyers, names of men in the different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
departments, such as the police and fire departments, besides
giving a list of all stores and manufactories in the town, their
owners and officers, and it is all in a very convenient form for
reference.</p>

<p>I will now describe a similar method of gaining possession
of questions by the aid of the boards, but in this case the
boards are free of preparation, but not so with the small slips
of paper distributed, on which the questions are written. One
side of these slips of paper is prepared by rubbing it over
with a piece of hard soap of good quality. Nothing will be
noticed about the paper except that one side seems to be
glazed. The cardboards used have a hard smooth face. In
passing out the slips of paper and boards the soaped side of
the paper is placed down upon the face of the board and
passed to members of the audience. They write their questions
upon these papers, naturally using the side uppermost.
The pencils provided have a rather blunt point.</p>

<p>These boards being collected they are carried back of
stage as in the former method. Here the boards are dusted
over with some pigment, such as bronze powder or lamp
black. This is now shaken off, and the questions written will
now show up plainly on the boards, the particles of lamp
black or whatever is used sticking to the outline of the
soap, which adhered to the board in the act of writing the
question, and which was not visible until dusted with this fine
powdered pigment.</p>

<p>The medium now having a list of questions on which she
has made up suitable answers conceals these in her dress and
comes forward onto the stage, where she is blind-folded. As
soon as the large sheet is thrown over her, however, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
pushes this bandage up from her eyes, and the sheet being of
thin material or having a number of threads drawn out in that
portion which covers her face, she is enabled to read her questions
and answers under the sheet.</p>

<p>I think this will fully describe the methods employed
where the questions are written upon the performer’s boards.</p>

<p>I will now describe a number of methods by which she
obtains questions which are written outside of the theatre,
and upon the people’s own paper.</p>

<p>Besides the ushers and assistants we see with the performer
at his exhibition he also employs a number of men
and women of whom the audience know nothing. They act
as assistants to the performer in many ways. Usually one
or two of them make a systematic canvass of the town to be
played in a week or so in advance of the performer in the
ostensible occupation of book-agent or peddler of some sort.
Their real mission is, however, to keep their eyes and ears
open and gain all the knowledge possible that may be of
assistance to their employer. They mail a list made up with
index to the performer before they leave the town for the
next. On this list they have described subjects of local interest
in the town which they have canvassed. The list may
contain a description of some local mystery, such as a robbery,
murder, fire or wreck, together with a list of names of
those persons who are, or are thought to be, implicated in
any way. If an election of any sort is soon to take place
they send the performer a list of the candidates, with the
probable successful candidates, and about how many votes
each is expected to carry. If some race or athletic event is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
soon to occur the favorites are mentioned.</p>

<p>This information the performer’s “advance guard” find
out from local papers and by overhearing conversations in
the hotels, on the streets, and at the houses and offices at
which they call. By using a little diplomacy, they can “pump”
a whole lot of local gossip and useful information from the
unsuspecting citizens whom they run across, all of which is
sent to the performer, who follows along a week or two
afterwards. This preliminary work is known by professionals
as “planting a town,” and the performer usually reaps the
harvest.</p>

<p>Another use of the confederates is to have them scattered
through the audience at the performances. They make
it their business to see and learn what questions those around
them write or have written. They can often overhear one
person telling another what question he has written. The
confederates or “cappers,” as they are known, make copies
of these questions they learn of by spying on those around
them and by hearing them talked of. Sometimes they cannot
get the person’s name, and in this case they give the number
of the seat the person is sitting in or a description of the
person. In other cases a person’s name is all they can see
or overhear. They write this down, however, for all information,
no matter how trivial, can be made use of in the performance.
The “cappers” also write down a description of
the question, whether written in ink or pencil and the color
of same, and a description of what it is written on, whether a
large, small or narrow piece of paper, card or envelope.</p>

<p>When the boards and papers are passed around the “cappers”
write down all the information they have gathered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
This writing by the “cappers” is not noticed by those sitting
around them, for they write the questions on one of the
boards distributed and at the same time all are writing. When
the “cappers” return the boards and pencils to the ushers
they pass the slips, containing the information which they
have gathered, rolled up in little balls to the ushers, who
take them in back of stage to the medium.</p>

<p>A star test is usually worked up by aid of the “cappers,”
the medium answering some question which they are supposed
to have written, about the past or present, describing
the details of what they inquire about in a very tragic manner,
the “cappers” announcing that all she tells them is absolutely
correct.</p>

<p>The treasurer or ticket seller of the theatre or hall is
usually taken into the confidence of the performer, and he can
furnish additional information, as he knows the people in
town well and by name, and is able to tell the performer what
seats they are sitting in. He is also able to draw out from
those buying tickets what questions they intend to ask, or
they will often volunteer the information, telling the treasurer
that they are coming to see the performance to find out
who stole their watch or who will be the next mayor, or
whatever they may wish to know. The treasurer makes a
note of all this, and this information is used in the act. The
person, however, who tells the treasurer what he would like
to know may not write the question at all. In this case,
the medium calling on him and being informed that he has
written no question states that he is thinking of such or such
a thing, and this adds greatly to the act and makes a number
of converts to occultism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>It will be seen now that if at every performance the four
or five “cappers” sitting among the audience are all successful
in finding out two or three questions which are written at
home or outside of the theatre and a description of what they
are written upon, together with what information is obtained
from the treasurer of the house, and also the questions which
the medium obtains from the “fake” boards, the medium has
now obtained abundant ammunition of mystery to fire at the
audience for about an hour, the solution of which passes
over their heads.</p>

<p>This method of employing confederates to find out questions
written outside of the theatre is, of course, expensive,
and some performers do not like to use it, not only on account
of the expense, but because often-times “cappers” or
“planters” leave the performers and start a show of their own
or give away some of the secrets, so some resort to another
method, which is simple and worked very openly, the working
of which I will now describe.</p>

<p>When the medium is covered with the sheet an assistant
under the stage passes up through a small hole or trap in
the floor either a rubber speaking-tube or a small telephone
receiver connected by wires. This is either connected to the
medium’s ear by a band which passes around her head or is
held to her ear by her hand. The rubber speaking-tube or
the wires from the telephone, whichever is used, run under
the stage to an assistant. The arrangement of theatres
being very different, there is no fixed place for the assistant
to conceal him or herself, but it is always in the most advantageous
position—sometimes at the side of the platform,
sometimes in one of the lower boxes, but usually underneath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
the stage, directly under the footlights or under the runway
which runs from the stage out to the auditorium. The sides
of this runway being boarded up or covered with rugs or
carpets, the assistant is concealed from view of the audience.
In one of the steps leading from the runway down to the
floor of the auditorium there is a secret opening, by means
of which the performer is able to pass, unobserved, slips of
paper containing questions and suggestions, which are read
by assistant and telephoned to medium sitting under sheet.</p>

<p>The performer usually stands near these steps and walks
back and forth, while his assistants or ushers wander over
the theatre locating the people whose names are called.</p>

<p>As the performer has requested the audience to take out
their questions and read them over, they are usually held in
their hands. The ushers often on seeing a person
holding a question ask to see it for the purpose of assisting
him in thinking about it. The ushers experience very
little difficulty in collecting these questions, as the majority of
the people in the audience believe that the performance is one
in pure thought reading, and think the reason their questions
are not answered is due to their being unable to concentrate
their thoughts upon them, and as they are usually anxious for
an answer are very willing to accept the proffered assistance
of the ushers and give them their questions outright. The usher
usually makes a few inquiries about the question. The usher,
if he does not retain the question or slip, on walking down
the aisle makes a copy of it on a little slip of paper, either in
longhand or in some code understood by the assistant, and
furthermore adds what information he has obtained about it.</p>

<p>Suppose the question be:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>“Where is my sister, Mary,” signed, “Annie Laurie.”
The usher asks Miss Laurie when and where her sister was
last heard from, and may be informed that it was a year ago,
from Germany.</p>

<p>On the questioner’s slip or copy of same he writes:
“last heard from in Germany a year ago.”</p>

<p>This slip and many others which he has obtained he
rolls up into small balls, and on passing the performer, or
under cover of talking to him, secretly passes him these slips.
The performer in turn passes them through trap opening in
the step to the assistant concealed under same, or possibly
drops them over the railing of the lower box, if the assistant
is concealed there, where they are gathered in from the floor
of the box by the assistant and telephoned to medium.</p>

<p>The medium is now able to answer the person’s inquiry
about their missing sister. She utilizes as much dramatic
power as possible in her answers and works them up cleverly,
often-times giving information in her answers which she
gains from the written question alone. For instance, she
will probably answer the “lost sister” question as follows:—</p>

<p>“Some one is sending me a thought from down stairs.
It is a lady and I think her name is Annie Laurie.”</p>

<p>“I see the lady right here!” exclaims an usher, and a
connection being now established between the medium and
Miss Laurie, she is able to read the question. She proceeds.</p>

<p>“Miss Laurie is sending me a thought about her sister,
and wants to know where she is.</p>

<p>“I think I can tell you your sister’s name, Miss Laurie.
It is Mary. Isn’t that right? Yes,—I thought so, and you
have not heard from her for over a year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>“It seems to me she is in a foreign land, and I seem to
see the flag of Germany.</p>

<p>“Your sister is well, Miss Laurie. She has written you
a letter and it is now on its way, and you will receive it next
Tuesday.”</p>

<p>“Wonderful!” exclaim the audience, and Miss Laurie
goes home a firm believer in the supernatural, wondering,
possibly, if there will be money in “Mary’s” letter.</p>

<p>The majority of questions written pertain to lost or
stolen articles and questions regarding the future. This is
natural, for most people are not interested in the past or
present. It, of course, makes the answering of the questions
very much easier for the medium, for where the questioner
is in ignorance about the answer she can tell him anything,
and the success of her answers is limited only by her skill
and dramatic ability.</p>

<p>There are, however, always a number of skeptics at the
performances, who try and test the value of the medium’s
answers by asking questions, the answers of which they know,
such as:—“What is the number of my watch?” “What was
the score of such and such a game?” “What is the date of
the coin in my hand?” etc. The answers to these have to be
worked out with more care, and is usually performed in this
way. The medium has gained knowledge of the question in
some of the preceding methods I have described, and when
she answers this question she calls out the questioner’s name,
and states that he or she is thinking about a watch, about a
game, or coin, or whatever the question may be about. She
states she cannot seem to see more, asking the person to
think intently about it and she may get it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>She now proceeds to answer some other questioner, but
she has given the performer a cue that she desires more information
about the question she left unanswered.</p>

<p>The performer now goes to the person, asks for his question
(we will in this case consider the questioner a man) and
reads it. He also asks for the answer, which is usually told
him. (If it is not the question will not be answered.) He now
tells the person to think about it intently and he may be answered.</p>

<p>The performer now leaves the person and walks down to
the stage. On his way, secretly or openly, the latter is usually
the better method of disarming the suspicious, he writes down
the answer to the question, such as the number of the watch,
score of the game or date of the coin, on a slip of paper. He
now passes this through trap to assistant, who reads it off to
medium, and she returns to the questioner, stating that she
can now see his question, reads it and answers it. Questions
of this kind always make a decided hit.</p>

<p>Some performers, when they wish to convey a number
to their assistant, do so by sign language, the assistant keeping
his eye on the performer through a peep-hole from his
place of concealment.</p>

<p>By the aid of a verbal code the number may be conveyed
directly to medium by a question or sentence spoken by performer.
I will explain an example of this code. For instance,
we will say</p>


<table class="autotable" style="width: 40%">
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Please, means</td>
<td class="tdr">1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Tell, means</td>
<td class="tdr">2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Can, means</td>
<td class="tdr">3<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">We, means</td>
<td class="tdr">4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Hurry, means</td>
<td class="tdr">5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Give, means</td>
<td class="tdr">6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Quick, means</td>
<td class="tdr">7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">I, means</td>
<td class="tdr">8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Speak, means</td>
<td class="tdr">9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">What, means</td>
<td class="tdr">0</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p>Suppose the performer wishes to communicate the number
68,401. He says to the medium:—</p>

<p>“Give us an answer. I wish it. We all do. What is the
number of so and so? Please tell me.”</p>

<p>By making short sentences or questions, using the code
word first in each sentence, the number is conveyed to medium.
It may also be done by making up one sentence and
slightly emphasizing the code word; for example:—</p>

<p>“<em>Give</em> Mr. Blank an answer, for <em>I</em> wish it and <em>we</em> all do;
<em>what</em> is it, <em>please</em>?”</p>

<p>There is another clever way of getting questions directly
to medium. On the medium’s first coming on the stage she
takes a seat on a chair that is upon a table, and is then covered
over with the sheet. This is done to show there is no connection
from underneath the stage, as the audience can see
under the table.</p>

<p>She now calls off a number of questions and answers
same. These are the questions, however, she has concealed
on her person, which she obtained from the boards or from
the “cappers” before going on.</p>

<p>She becomes restless after a while, however, and requests
to be taken down from the table. The performer and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
one of the ushers go upon the stage and lift her, chair and all,
on to the floor. The performer and usher have in their hands
a quantity of questions they have collected from the audience,
or copied, rolled up in little balls, and in lifting medium down
from the table place their hands under the sheet in a perfectly
natural way to take hold of the chair. Under cover of
the sheet, however, the medium takes the questions from
their hands, and now has ammunition for a lot more mystery.</p>

<p>It will be seen that there are any quantity of ways to get
questions to the medium.</p>

<p>Regarding the part of performance where the medium
describes a card or envelope which the performer holds in his
hand on which some person has written his question, she is
not only reading the question but the printed matter on the
card or envelope as well. This is often done by holding the
article to be described so that the concealed assistant at the
side or under the stage or in a lower box can see it through
a small peep-hole, either with his naked eye, or with the assistance
of a powerful spy-glass, with which he is able to read
fine print, the information being immediately telephoned to
medium.</p>

<p>Some performers do not cover the medium with a sheet.
In this case one of the rear legs of the chair, in which she sits,
comes directly over a small hole in the stage. The leg of the
chair is hollow and this opening extends up the back of the
chair, the chair being one of the bent-wood variety.</p>

<p>The medium has a small rubber tube, one end connected
to her ear, the other end running around her head and down
the back of her neck. This tube is concealed by her hair and
dress. The performer, in blind-folding the medium, slips the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
free end of this tube into a small hole in the back of the chair
which opens into the hollow back and leg. One end of another
tube is passed up through the hole in the floor into the
hollow chair leg; the other end of this tube is in the hands of
the assistant where he has concealed himself. Anything
whispered into this end, to which is attached a mouth-piece,
is distinctly heard by medium.</p>

<p>The rest is easy, for instead of medium having a list of
questions to read they are in possession of assistant, who
reads them to her through the speaking tube, together with
notes regarding the answers and all other information passed
into him by performer. In my opinion, this is a very
much neater way of performing the trick, for there has never
been a good reason advanced for covering the medium with
a sheet.</p>


<h3>CLOSING REMARKS.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="42" height="50" alt="drop-cap">
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> must be remembered that in this little volume the
author has not been able to enumerate and discuss
all the methods used by clairvoyants or mind-readers
on the public stage, or suggest what methods they
will next use, for they will surely plan and contrive new ones
as soon as the old methods are discovered. But I think, however,
by the aid of the preceding explanations and suggestions
the reader will perceive how most of the performances
of this kind are now accomplished, and by the knowledge of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
these secrets discover other methods and, possibly, those to
come in the future.</p>

<p>I hope I have been successful in removing my readers
from the hazy clouds of occultism and bringing them to earth,
where we are all predestined to remain, both body and soul,
until death. The only mind that any of us can read is that
of our own, and that, many times, not too well. If any of us
could fathom the thoughts of others an interview with financiers
of Wall Street would enable us to own the world in a
short time, especially if we could also predict the future,
which would be, in my opinion, an easier and shorter way of
gaining earthly riches than two performances a day at popular
prices.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">I will</span> now explain a few simple little tricks in second
sight which may be performed by any one in
his own home, but which, if well done, will be very
mystifying.</p>


<h3>DISAPPEARANCE OF A CARD THOUGHT OF BY A
SPECTATOR.</h3>

<p>The performer brings forward a pack of cards which he
shuffles well, and then passes the cards from one hand to the
other with faces toward the audience. A spectator is now
asked to remember any card he sees. Upon this being done
the performer again shuffles the cards and passes them from
hand to hand, one at a time, when it is discovered that the
card thought of has disappeared. A second card is similarly
treated.</p>

<p>To produce the above effect the performer takes an ordinary
pack of fifty-two cards, but pastes them back to back,
so he really has twenty-six cards with a face on each side. It
will thus be seen that on one side are pictures of twenty-six
cards and on the other side the remaining twenty-six. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
the spectator has thought of any card the performer in
shuffling the pack merely turns them over and next exposes
the other side. It will be readily seen that any card selected,
in fact, all of the cards first exposed have now apparently disappeared.
To any one with a pack of cards so arranged
would be suggested a number of clever experiments, such as
changing the colors of the cards from all red to all black, and
by waving a single card in the air to change its suit and
color, etc., etc.</p>


<h3>DISCOVERING A SELECTED COIN.</h3>

<p>In this experiment the performer has an assistant, usually
a young lady as the effect is better, whom he blind-folds,
and she takes a seat in the room. He next borrows a number
of coins from those in the audience, and has some one
person select a coin. The performer asks this person to
notice the coin carefully so that he can identify it. He then
asks the person to hold the coin tightly in his hand and think
very intently about it. The rest of the coins are now placed
in a hat, and after a short period the person who has selected
a coin is asked to drop the coin into the hat with the others.
The coins are now well shaken up, and the hat taken to the
blind-folded assistant. She puts her hand into the hat and
promptly withdraws the selected coin. This, while a very
simple trick, is very effective. The coin which the person
selects and holds in his hand becomes slightly warm from the
heat of the hand, and the assistant is thus able to distinguish
it from the other coins, which are cool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>


<h3>TEST IN ADDITION.</h3>

<p>In this experiment the performer brings forward an ordinary
slate and piece of crayon and requests some person to
write a column of figures on the slate. The performer now
takes the slate, quickly draws a line underneath the column of
figures, and places the slate, face downward, on a table, on
the top of slate placing a small piece of crayon. His assistant,
who has been out of the room during this part of the experiment,
now enters, and on walking up to the slate picks up
the crayon and marks down the total sum of figures on the
other side of the slate, which are found to be absolutely correct
on turning the slate over and adding the figures up.</p>

<p>To perform this experiment the performer is armed with
a small piece of crayon in addition to the crayon which he
gives to the spectator. One side of the crayon which he retains
is filed smooth. The performer also has a small lead
pencil concealed in his hand along with the crayon. When
the person in the audience is writing down the figures the
performer mentally adds these up, and secretly writes the sum
total on this small piece of chalk which he has in his hand.
He now takes the slate, places it face downward upon the
table, and on top of it places the prepared piece of chalk,
flat side down, retaining the chalk which the spectator used.
All that is now necessary is for his assistant to pick up the
piece of chalk, secretly read the figures written on it, and
mark them down upon the slate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>


<h3>SECOND SIGHT TRICKS.</h3>

<p>By the following method quite mysterious tricks may be
performed in one’s own house. The performer’s assistant is
blind-folded and sits in a remote part of the room. She has
attached to her finger an end of a fine black silk thread. The
other end of this thread the performer carries. He is now
able by sharp twitches upon the cord to communicate with
his assistant, telling her the dates of coins, the suit of a card,
the number of a watch and many other experiments by using
a little code which they have arranged between them. It is
needless to say the performer must keep his hand hidden in
making these twitches on the thread so as not to be observed
by the audience. This little trick can be worked up with
good effect, as the performer may stand quite some distance
from his assistant, and no words are spoken.</p>


<h3>ENVELOPE TRICK.</h3>

<p>A person is requested to write a question with ink upon
a card. The card is now placed in an envelope and sealed.
The performer takes the envelope from the room for a few
seconds. On coming back he returns the envelope to its
owner and also another envelope, which on being opened
will be found to contain a card, on which is written an answer
to his question. The envelope, however, in which his question
is sealed shows no evidence of having been tampered
with in the slightest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>When the performer leaves the room he immediately
takes a sponge which is saturated with alcohol and rubs it
over the surface of the envelope, which makes it transparent,
and he is thus able to read what is written on the card
inside. He then writes a suitable answer on another card,
which he seals in another envelope. The alcohol evaporating
very quickly there is no sign of it upon the envelope when
returned to its owner.</p>
